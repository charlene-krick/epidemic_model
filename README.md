# Epidemic model of RSV virus 
In this project, we propose to study an age-structured mathematical model for respiratory syncytial virus where we will focus on people over 50 years old. Real data on hospitalized people over 50 years old in the Spanish region of Valencia were used in order to determine some seasonal parameters of the model.

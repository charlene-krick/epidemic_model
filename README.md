# Epidemic model of RSV virus 
## Abstract
In this project, we propose to study an age-structured mathematical model for respiratory syncytial virus where we will focus on people over 50 years old. Real data on hospitalized people over 50 years old in the Spanish region of Valencia were used in order to determine some seasonal parameters of the model.
Weekly predictions of the number of adults older than 50
years old that will be hospitalized in the following years in Valencia are presented using this model. Results
are applied to estimate and discuss about vaccination strategies.
